# leet-index
NOTE: this is a really unfinished project and its honestly really trash and needs work but I figured someone might be interested in it.

simple productivity metric for programmers

leet-index is a tool to quantify productivity by using a qualitative(lines of code) and quantitative(time) factor
it allows you to have an objective idea of how much work you can do in a set amount of time and assess your productivity levels throughout a given set of time ex. per week

# logic
There are 2 parts to the Leet index.
our leet-score can be quantified by calculating:
lines of code written / time spent writing it

you can then find your Leet index by calculating the average of all your Leet scores
